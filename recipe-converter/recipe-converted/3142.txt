Ingredients

1 swede, peeled and cut into cubes
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 onion, finely chopped
2 carrots, finely sliced
2 stalks celery, finely sliced
1 clove garlic, crushed
6 stalks fresh thyme, leaves only
1.25 litres/2 pints vegetable stock
142ml/5fl oz carton single cream
fresh thyme leaves to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the cubes of swede in a roasting tray. Drizzle over two tablespoons of the olive oil and season.


Roast in oven for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and tender, stirring occasionally.


Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large heavy-based saucepan, stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic and thyme leaves and fry for 4-5 minutes until softened but not browned.


Add the roasted swede to the pan and pour over the stock.


Bring gently to the boil, cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.


Purée the soup in a food processor or liquidiser until completely smooth. Pass through a sieve for an extra fine texture if preferred.


Transfer the soup back to a clean saucepan. Stir in most of the cream, reserving some for garnishing. Gently heat through and adjust the seasoning if necessary.


Serve in warm bowls or a soup tureen and garnish with a swirl of cream, some fresh thyme leaves and freshly ground black pepper.
