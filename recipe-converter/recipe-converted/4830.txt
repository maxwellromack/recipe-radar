Ingredients

1 whole small Camembert cheese (in a wooden box)
2 cloves garlic, sliced
1 tbsp maple syrup
2 sprigs fresh thyme
2 slices crusty white bread
olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
small handful Chantenay carrots (or other small carrots), cooked




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Remove the Camembert from its packaging, pierce the top of the cheese with a sharp knife, then stuff the incisions with the garlic, thyme and drizzle with maple syrup. Wrap the cheese in aluminium foil and place back into the wooden box. Place on a baking sheet in the oven and bake for ten minutes.


Brush the bread with the olive oil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and griddle in a hot griddle pan until golden-brown on both sides. Cut into soldiers.


To serve, place the whole Camembert onto a serving plate and unwrap the foil. Serve with the cooked carrots and toast soldiers on the side for dipping into the cheese.
