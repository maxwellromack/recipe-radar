Ingredients

30g/1oz unsalted butter
3 Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and sliced
1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves
110g/4oz cavalo nero (black-leaf kale), chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 pheasant thighs
1 tbsp flatleaf parsley, chopped




Method


Melt the butter in a pan. Add the artichokes and thyme leaves and sauté for 5-6 minutes, to soften.


Add the cavello nero and cook to soften for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.


In a separate frying pan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil. Season the pheasant thighs with salt and freshly ground black pepper, place in the pan and cook for 5-6 minutes on each side, until golden and thoroughly cooked.


To serve, transfer the artichoke mixture to a serving dish. Top with the pheasant thighs and sprinkle with parsley.
