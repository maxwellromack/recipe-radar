Ingredients
For the scallops

4 scallops
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the salsa

½ baby pineapple, peeled, chopped
1 vine tomato, chopped
2 spring onions, chopped
pinch chilli flakes

To serve

handful rocket leaves




Method


For the scallops, season the scallops with salt and freshly ground black pepper and drizzle over the olive oil. Heat a frying pan until smoking and sear the scallops for 30 seconds to one minute on both sides, or until just cooked through and golden-brown all over. Remove from the pan and keep warm.


For the salsa, place all of the salsa ingredients to the pan used to cook the scallops and heat for 1-2 minutes to warm through.


Arrange a handful of rocket on a serving plate and place the scallops on top. Spoon the salsa over and serve.
