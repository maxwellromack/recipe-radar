Ingredients

110g/4oz puff pastry
plain flour, to dust
1 beef tomato, cut into slices
handful of fresh basil leaves
55-85g/2-3 oz gruyère cheese, grated
freshly ground black pepper, to season
1 egg, beaten




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Roll the pastry out thinly on a floured surface. Cut a large circle out and place on a non-stick baking tray. Crumple the edges of the pastry roughly using your fingers.


Place the tomato slices in the middle of the pastry circle and then top with the basil. Sprinkle the cheese over and season with black pepper.


Brush the edges of the tart using the egg wash and then bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until crisp and golden.


Serve.
