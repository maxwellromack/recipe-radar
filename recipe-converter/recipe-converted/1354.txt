Ingredients

500ml/18fl oz hot vegetable oil
100g/3½oz self-raising flour
1 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp sesame seeds
30ml/1fl oz sparkling water
7 broccoli florets




Method


Heat the vegetable oil in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan, until a breadcrumb sizzles and browns when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended!)


Place the flour, cumin seeds and sesame seeds into a large bowl and mix together.


Add the sparkling water and whisk vigorously to form a batter.


Dip the broccoli florets into the batter and carefully place into the hot oil and deep-fry in batches, so as not to overcrowd the pan. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen towels.


To serve, place into a warm bowl.
