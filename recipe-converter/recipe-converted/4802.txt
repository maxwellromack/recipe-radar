This isn’t your average ham, egg and chips: Tom Kerridge takes it up a notch with homemade chips and fried duck eggs.

Ingredients

15 large potatoes suitable for chipping
vegetable oil, for deep-frying
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 thick slices good-quality ham
75g/3oz butter
4 duck eggs
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley




Method


Trim the ends of the potatoes and cut into chips. Cook in salted boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until just tender, then drain.


Heat the oil in a deep fat fryer to 140C/285F (CAUTION: Hot oil may be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Fry the chips for 8-10 minutes, then remove from the oil and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, reheat the oil to 180C/350F and fry the chips for 4-5 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oil, set aside to drain on kitchen paper and season with salt.


Fill a frying pan with 1cm/½in water and bring to the boil. Add the butter and once it has melted, add the sliced ham and cook for 1-2 minutes.


Remove the ham slices and place onto serving plates. Season with freshly ground black pepper.


In a frying pan add a little vegetable oil and fry the duck eggs until cooked to your liking. Place on the serving plates, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve the chips alongside.




Recipe Tips
After the first frying the chips can be kept in the fridge for up to a couple of days until you're ready to finish cooking them.
