Ingredients

large handful friseé lettuce
4 slices ciabatta, toasted
2 free-range eggs, out of their shells
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp white wine vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Bring a pan full of salted water to the boil.


Give the water a stir and add one egg. Let it poach for 2-3 minutes or until the white is cooked and the middle is runny. Remove with a slotted spoon.


Repeat with the other egg and set them both aside.


Dress the lettuce with the oil and vinegar.


Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, put the slices of toast on the side of the plate and the eggs on top of the salad in the middle of the plate.
