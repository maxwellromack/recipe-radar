Ingredients

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
125g/4½oz tagliatelle
large handful mixed fresh herbs, including parsley, basil, coriander, chervil, chopped
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
pinch salt
1 chilli, seeds removed, chopped
2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted




Method


Place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Place the tagliatelle into a large pan of boiling salted water and cook until just al dente. Drain well and leave to cool for five minutes.


Carefully place the pasta into the hot oil in batches and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat until all the pasta has been fried.


Place the deep-fried pasta into a bowl. Add the herbs, balsamic vinegar, salt, chilli and sesame seeds to the bowl and mix well.


To serve, place the salad into a large serving dish.
