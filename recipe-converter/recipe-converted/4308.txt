Ingredients

4 digestive biscuits
1 tbsp butter, softened
300g/10½oz full-fat cream cheese
4 pieces stem ginger in syrup, 2 finely chopped, 2 halved, plus 4 tbsp syrup from the jar
3 tbsp grated dark chocolate

To serve

2 sugar twists (optional)




Method


Crush the biscuits by placing them into a bag or clean tea towel and hitting with a rolling pin. Pour the crumbs into a bowl and mix with the softened butter. Place two 5cm/2in chefs' rings onto serving plates and fill with the crumb mixture to form the base of the cheesecake.


Place the cream cheese into a bowl with the chopped stem ginger and about four tablespoons of the syrup from the jar and mix well. Spoon the mixture into the rings and smooth the top with a palette knife.


Sprinkle each cheesecake with the grated chocolate, then top with the ginger pieces.


To loosen the rings, quickly warm around the edges using a warm cloth or a mini-blowtorch, then lift off the rings.


To serve, garnish with a sugar twist.
